Component\\r\\n\\r\\nConfiguration JS objects\\r\\n\\r\\n## Installation\\r\\n\\r\\n```bash\\r\\nnpm install @IntusFacultas/design-system@latest --save\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Purpose\\r\\n\\r\\nThis provides a set of themes used by a number of components. You can import the themes by importing one of the following options, but most components import them by default. You can import them in order to develop with them, and have the following objects available:\\r\\n\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nNIWSTheme;\\r\\nTextTheme;\\r\\nNASICTheme;\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Defining Your Own Themes\\r\\n\\r\\nDefining your own themes for your own projects is simple.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Import ThemeProvider from vue-styled-components\\r\\n\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nimport { ThemeProvider } from \\\"vue-styled-components\\\";\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Define a Themes Object\\r\\n\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nlet THEMES = {\\r\\n  FlavorName: {\\r\\n    color: {\\r\\n      color: \\\"#fff\\\",\\r\\n      focus: \\\"#fff\\\",\\r\\n      hover: \\\"#fff\\\"\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    background: {\\r\\n      color: \\\"#4357AD\\\",\\r\\n      hover: \\\"#2940A1\\\",\\r\\n      focus: \\\"#4357AD\\\"\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    border: {\\r\\n      color: \\\"#4357AD\\\",\\r\\n      hover: \\\"#2940A1\\\",\\r\\n      focus: \\\"#4357AD\\\"\\r\\n    }\\r\\n  }\\r\\n};\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Assign your Themes object to the theme provider in your component\\r\\n\\r\\n```html\\r\\n<theme-provider :theme=\\\"THEMES\\\">\\r\\n  <some-other-styled-component></some-other-styled-component>\\r\\n</theme-provider>\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n4. All components considered child nodes of the ThemeProvider will inherit that theme and attempt to use your themes before falling back on the default NASIC themes.\\r\\n\"","import { render,

Component\\r\\n\\r\\nVue Styled Component - https://github.com/styled-components/vue-styled-components\\r\\n\\r\\n## Installation\\r\\n\\r\\n```bash\\r\\nnpm install @IntusFacultas/layout@latest --save\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Purpose\\r\\n\\r\\nThis provides a Flex grid that has responsive breakpoints, providing a greater degree of programmatic control than the Bootstrap col-row system.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Usage\\r\\n\\r\\nThe minimum configuration needed is passing a number to the `col` prop of the FlexColumn. If a number is not passed, the column defaults to 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n```html\\r\\n<flex-row>\\r\\n  <flex-column\\r\\n    :col=\\\"col\\\"\\r\\n    :xs=\\\"xs\\\"\\r\\n    :sm=\\\"sm\\\"\\r\\n    :md=\\\"md\\\"\\r\\n    :lg=\\\"lg\\\"\\r\\n    :xl=\\\"xl\\\"\\r\\n  ></flex-column>\\r\\n</flex-row>\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nimport {FlexRow} from \\\"@IntusFacultas/layout\\\";\\r\\nimport {FlexRow, FlexColumn} from \\\"@IntusFacultas/layout\\\";\\r\\ndata: {\\r\\n    col: 1,\\r\\n    xs: 1,\\r\\n    sm: 1,\\r\\n    md: 1,\\r\\n    lg: 1,\\r\\n

Usage\\r\\n\\r\\n```html\\r\\n<placeholder :height=\\\"height\\\"></placeholder>\\r\\n<placeholder-picture :height=\\\"height\\\"

\\\"100px\\\",\\r\\n  width: \\\"100px\\\"\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe placeholder component will expand to the full width of the parent container, and will automatically populate in paragraphs if the paragraph is set to true.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor paragraphs to display, the height must be at least 170px.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Configuration\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious Vue Component Props have been exposed for

@IntusFacultas/vue-toast@latest --save\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Purpose\\r\\n\\r\\nThis provides a jQuery Toastr style alert system\\r\\n\\r\\n# Usage\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen instantiating your component, it is extremely important to bind a Vue instance to the parentInstance attribute, as that instance will be the instance that has the \\\\$toast method bound to it, by which you will call toasts.\\r\\n\\r\\n```html\\r\\n<vue-toast\\r\\n  :max-width=\\\"maxWidth\\\"\\r\\n  :delay=\\\"delay\\\"\\r\\n

customizing the behavior of the component.\\r\\n- The flavors are chosen from the AlertTheme in `@IntusFacultas/design-system`\\r\\n- Special note: camelCase props need to be converted to kebab-case
